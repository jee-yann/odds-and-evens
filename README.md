# Odds and evens (hand game)

Odds and evens game is a very simple game.

Setup: Two players face each other.
Decision: One player decides if they want to be odds or evens. Let’s say Player A chooses evens.
Gameplay: Both players simultaneously show any number of fingers from 0 to 5.
Counting: If the total number of fingers shown by both players is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10), Player A wins because they chose evens. If it’s odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), Player B wins because they didn’t choose evens.
Winner: The player who correctly predicted the total (odd or even) wins that round.
Repeat: Players can play multiple rounds to determine an overall winner.
Consider that it is not really important what the exact numbers the players show are; what is important is whether they are odds or evens.

A human player plays against an artificial intelligence (AI), called HAL-9000 (I hope you get the reference :)). This is a game of chance, but also a game of psychology! The AI will try to learn the behaviour of the human player and attempt to guess the player’s next move.
